#### # Basics of A/B testing

> Question: How many changes do you track in a single A/B Test ? 

_Answer  : In A/B Tests we only change a single variable ( eg . Size of picture / Color of CTA button ) in the Base ( A ) , to create the **Variant** ( B ). And then , we keep an eye on the metrics to see if Variant produced the type of results we expected or not_

>  Question : Why do we only change a single variable, why not change multiple things all at once and see how well that version with multiple changes did with respect to the Base ? 

_Answer : The data is not concussive , if we track the effect multiple changes had in an experiment. So A/B tests only have a single change between the **Base** and the **Variant**.   
In this way we can be sure the variation in data was only because of tha SINGLE change_

`Eg : If we change the size of a `[ Buy Now ]` button , and if the sales went up by 25% , we can conclusively say that increasing the size of the button , in itself , had that effect on the sales`

#### # Experiments as a form of Validation

There are `4 metrics` which are used to evaluate the results of an experiment you conduct w.r.t your product 

1. **Primary Metric ( Generally the North Star Metric )** :
    
   + Eg. No. of Likes / No. of Subscribers / Sales
   + If the change in this metric is STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT , then you can conclusively say whether the impact of the change was Positive or Negative .

1. **Supporting Metric** :
    + There can be only 1 primary metric, but there can be multiple supporting metrics .
    + These are metrics , that hint towards the experiment going in the right/wrong direction 
    + Eg. If you take Amazon , and if while conduction an experiment you find there there is a decrease in the number of returns / cancellations and lesser number of customer support calls etc. , then this points towards your primary metric being met , in the near future.
