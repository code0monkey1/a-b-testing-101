#### # Basics of A/B testing

> Question: How many changes do you track in a single A/B Test ? 

_Answer  : In A/B Tests we only change a single variable ( eg . Size of picture / Color of CTA button ) in the Base ( A ) , to create the **Variant** ( B ). And then , we keep an eye on the metrics to see if Variant produced the type of results we expected or not_

>  Question : Why do we only change a single variable, why not change multiple things all at once and see how well that version with multiple changes did with respect to the Base ? 

_Answer : The data is not concussive , if we track the effect multiple changes had in an experiment. So A/B tests only have a single change between the **Base** and the **Variant**.   
In this way we can be sure the variation in data was only because of tha SINGLE change_

`Eg : If we change the size of a `[ Buy Now ]` button , and if the sales went up by 25% , we can conclusively say that increasing the size of the button , in itself , had that effect on the sales`
